### What is that? 🚀🪐
I made this as a quick experiment in procedural planet generation, where you can fly a plane through a dynamic world. Built in about a day, it features basic flight, a procedural planet, and a skybox. There’s still room for improvement, and maybe I’ll refine it later. 

### Goals
- [ ] procedural planets
- [ ] atmosphere
